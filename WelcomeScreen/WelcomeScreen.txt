➡️ Function calling and GUI logic

Here’s a complete list of **viva questions and answers** tailored exactly to your code 👇

## 🎯 **Viva Questions and Answers — Welcome Screen GUI (Tkinter)**

---

### 🧠 **1. Basic Concepts**

**Q1. What is Tkinter in Python?**
**A:** Tkinter is Python’s standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) library used to create windows, buttons, labels, and other graphical components for desktop applications.

---

**Q2. Why do we import `ttk` from tkinter?**
**A:** `ttk` provides **themed widgets** (like buttons, labels, and frames) that look more modern and professional than basic Tkinter widgets.

---

**Q3. What is the purpose of `messagebox` in this code?**
**A:** It’s used to display **popup messages** like “Navigating to Login Screen” or “Navigating to Sign Up Screen”.

---

**Q4. What does `root.mainloop()` do?**
**A:** It starts Tkinter’s **event loop**, which keeps the GUI window running and responsive until the user closes it.

---

**Q5. What is the role of `root.geometry("500x350")`?**
**A:** It sets the **window size** to 500 pixels wide and 350 pixels tall.

---

**Q6. What does `root.resizable(False, False)` do?**
**A:** It disables window resizing, so the user cannot change the size of the GUI window.

---

---

### 🎨 **2. GUI Design & Layout**

**Q7. What is the purpose of the `Frame` widget?**
**A:** A `Frame` acts as a **container** to organize and group related widgets together.

---

**Q8. Why are two frames (`main_frame` and `content_frame`) used in this code?**
**A:**

* `main_frame` centers the content inside the window.
* `content_frame` holds all widgets (labels and buttons) neatly grouped together.

---

**Q9. What is the difference between `pack()` and `grid()`?**
**A:**

* `pack()` arranges widgets in blocks (top, bottom, left, right).
* `grid()` places widgets in a **table-like row-column layout**.

---

**Q10. What does `expand=True` and `fill="both"` in `pack()` do?**
**A:**

* `expand=True` allows the frame to take up any extra space available.
* `fill="both"` lets the frame expand **horizontally and vertically**.

---

**Q11. Why is `wraplength=400` used in the subtitle label?**
**A:** It ensures that long text wraps automatically to a new line after 400 pixels, preventing it from going outside the window.

---

**Q12. What does `justify="center"` do in the label?**
**A:** It aligns the wrapped text **in the center** of the label.

---

---

### 🧩 **3. Widgets in the Code**

**Q13. What is the function of the `Label` widget?**
**A:** It displays **text** on the screen — here used for “Welcome!” and the subtitle.

---

**Q14. What is the `Button` widget used for?**
**A:** It allows user interaction — clicking triggers a function (e.g., `go_to_login()` or `go_to_signup()`).

---

**Q15. What does `command=go_to_login` mean?**
**A:** It links the button to the function `go_to_login`, so when the button is clicked, that function executes.

---

**Q16. What happens when the user clicks the “Login” button?**
**A:** A popup message appears saying “Navigating to Login Screen...”.

---

**Q17. What happens when the user clicks the “Sign Up” button?**
**A:** A popup message appears saying “Navigating to Sign Up Screen...”.

---

**Q18. What is the use of `padx`, `pady`, `ipadx`, and `ipady`?**
**A:**

* `padx` / `pady`: Add external space around widgets.
* `ipadx` / `ipady`: Add **internal padding** (makes buttons appear larger).

---

**Q19. What does the `font=("Arial", 32, "bold")` argument do?**
**A:** It changes the **font type**, **size**, and **style** (bold) of the text displayed on the label.

---

**Q20. Why are the buttons placed inside another frame (`button_frame`)?**
**A:** To easily **align them side by side** (using `pack(side="left")`).

---

---

### ⚙️ **4. Functions & Events**

**Q21. What is the purpose of the `go_to_login()` and `go_to_signup()` functions?**
**A:** They simulate navigation actions. In a real app, they would **switch** the window from the welcome screen to the login or signup page.

---

**Q22. What does `messagebox.showinfo()` do?**
**A:** It displays an **informational popup window** with a title and a message.

---

**Q23. Can you make these buttons actually open new windows?**
**A:** Yes, by using:

```python
tk.Toplevel(root)
```

to open a new window or destroying the current frame and creating a new one.

---

**Q24. Why is this code called “event-driven programming”?**
**A:** Because Tkinter runs on **events** — user actions like button clicks trigger specific functions (called event handlers).

---

**Q25. Can multiple widgets use the same function as a command?**
**A:** Yes, many widgets (like buttons) can share the same function as their command.

---

---

### 💡 **5. Advanced or Conceptual Questions**

**Q26. What would happen if you don’t call `mainloop()`?**
**A:** The window will **open and immediately close**, because there’s no event loop keeping it running.

---

**Q27. What is the use of `root.title("Welcome to MyApp")`?**
**A:** It sets the **title** displayed on the window’s title bar.

---

**Q28. What happens if you remove `expand=True` from `pack()`?**
**A:** The widgets won’t be centered properly — they’ll stick to the top or side of the window.

---

**Q29. Why do we use emoji (👋) in the title label?**
**A:** To make the interface more friendly and engaging — Tkinter supports basic Unicode emojis.

---

**Q30. What is a placeholder function?**
**A:** It’s a temporary function used to simulate real behavior (like navigation) until actual functionality is added.

---

**Q31. How can this welcome screen be connected to real login/signup pages?**
**A:** By replacing the `messagebox.showinfo()` calls with code that:

* **Destroys** the current frame
* **Creates** a new frame or window containing the login/signup widgets.

---

**Q32. What does `root = tk.Tk()` do?**
**A:** It creates the **main application window** — the root of all widgets in the program.

---

**Q33. Can we change the background color of the window?**
**A:** Yes, using:

```python
root.config(bg="lightblue")
```

---

**Q34. Why are we using `ttk.Button` instead of `tk.Button`?**
**A:** `ttk.Button` gives a **modern themed appearance**, whereas `tk.Button` looks older and system-dependent.

---

**Q35. What is meant by `wraplength=400` in the subtitle label?**
**A:** It wraps the text automatically after 400 pixels, so it fits neatly in the window.
