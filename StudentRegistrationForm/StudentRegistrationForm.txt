This type of question is very common in **Python practical exams** and the viva focuses on:

* Tkinter widget knowledge
* Validation logic
* GUI structure and event handling

Below are **30+ possible viva questions with simple answers**, tailored specifically for your exact code 👇

## 🧠 **Viva Questions & Answers — Student Registration Form GUI**

---

### 🎯 **Basic Tkinter Concepts**

**Q1. What is Tkinter in Python?**
**A:** Tkinter is Python’s standard library used to build **Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)** for desktop applications.

---

**Q2. Why do we use `from tkinter import ttk`?**
**A:** `ttk` provides **themed widgets** (modern-looking versions) of Tkinter’s default widgets such as `Label`, `Button`, `Frame`, etc.

---

**Q3. What is the purpose of `messagebox`?**
**A:** It displays **popup messages** like errors, confirmations, or information — for example, showing “Registration Successful” or “Please fill all fields”.

---

**Q4. What does `root.mainloop()` do?**
**A:** It starts the Tkinter **event loop**, keeping the GUI window open and responsive until the user closes it.

---

**Q5. What is the role of `root.geometry("500x500")`?**
**A:** It sets the **window size** to 500 pixels wide and 500 pixels tall.

---

---

### 🧩 **Widgets & Their Roles**

**Q6. What is the function of the `Label` widget?**
**A:** `Label` is used to display static text, such as field names (“Name”, “Email”, etc.).

---

**Q7. What is the `Entry` widget used for?**
**A:** `Entry` is a single-line text box for user input (e.g., Name or Email).

---

**Q8. What is a `Radiobutton`?**
**A:** It allows the user to select **only one option** from multiple choices — here it’s used for Gender (Male/Female/Other).

---

**Q9. What is the role of the `Listbox` widget in this program?**
**A:** The `Listbox` shows a list of available courses (like Computer Science, Medicine, etc.) from which the user can **select one**.

---

**Q10. What is a `Checkbutton` used for?**
**A:** It allows users to select or agree to an option, here used for **“I agree to the terms and conditions”**.

---

**Q11. What is the use of `Scrollbar` in this program?**
**A:** The `Scrollbar` is linked with the `Listbox` to allow scrolling when there are many course options.

---

**Q12. What is the purpose of `Frame` in Tkinter?**
**A:** Frames are **containers** that hold and organize widgets, helping to group related components (like buttons or radiobuttons) together.

---

---

### ⚙️ **Variables and Functions**

**Q13. What is the purpose of `StringVar()` in Tkinter?**
**A:** It stores **string-type values** from widgets like `Radiobutton` so that they can be accessed later in the program.

---

**Q14. What does `BooleanVar()` do?**
**A:** It stores `True` or `False` values, commonly used with `Checkbutton` widgets.

---

**Q15. What is the function of `register_student()`?**
**A:** It collects user inputs (name, email, gender, course, etc.), validates them, and shows the registration details in a popup message.

---

**Q16. What is the purpose of the `clear_form()` function?**
**A:** It resets all input fields — clears text boxes, unchecks checkboxes, deselects listbox, and resets radio buttons.

---

**Q17. Why do we call `clear_form()` after successful registration?**
**A:** To prepare the form for a **new registration** by clearing all previous data.

---

---

### 🔍 **Validation & Logic**

**Q18. Why is there a validation check for `if not name or not email or not gender or course == "Not Selected":`?**
**A:** It ensures that **all required fields** are filled before submitting the form.

---

**Q19. What happens if no course is selected in the Listbox?**
**A:** The code handles it using a `try-except` block — if no selection is made, the variable `course` is set to **"Not Selected"**.

---

**Q20. Why is a `try-except` block used in `register_student()`?**
**A:** To **avoid program crashes** (IndexError) when a user tries to register without selecting a course.

---

**Q21. What happens if the user doesn’t agree to the terms and conditions?**
**A:** An error message appears using `messagebox.showerror()` and the registration process stops.

---

**Q22. Why is `.get()` used in this code?**
**A:** `.get()` retrieves the **current value** from widgets like `Entry`, `Radiobutton`, and Tkinter variables.

---

**Q23. What does `.delete(0, tk.END)` do?**
**A:** It clears the text inside the `Entry` widget from the first character (index 0) to the end.

---

**Q24. Why do we use `.selection_clear(0, tk.END)` in `clear_form()`?**
**A:** To **deselect any selected item** in the Listbox after the form is cleared.

---

**Q25. What is the purpose of `focus_set()` in the clear function?**
**A:** It automatically moves the **cursor back to the Name field**, ready for the next input.

---

---

### 💻 **GUI Layout & Styling**

**Q26. What is the difference between `pack()` and `grid()`?**
**A:**

* `pack()` arranges widgets in blocks (top, bottom, left, right).
* `grid()` arranges them in a **row-column** layout (like a table).

---

**Q27. What does `sticky="w"` mean in grid layout?**
**A:** It aligns the widget **to the west (left)** side of the cell.

---

**Q28. Why are `Frames` used inside other widgets (like for buttons or radiobuttons)?**
**A:** To **organize** layout neatly — placing multiple buttons or radio buttons in a single row or group.

---

**Q29. Why is `exportselection=False` used in the Listbox?**
**A:** It ensures that the **selected item remains highlighted** even if another Listbox (if any) gains focus.

---

**Q30. Why is `state=False` used in the Checkbutton variable reset?**
**A:** It unchecks the checkbox when clearing the form.

---

---

### 🧩 **General & Conceptual Questions**

**Q31. Can you select more than one course in this Listbox?**
**A:** No, by default Listbox allows **single selection**. To allow multiple, we can set `selectmode="multiple"`.

---

**Q32. What is the advantage of using Tkinter for small projects?**
**A:**

* Built-in with Python (no installation needed)
* Easy to learn
* Cross-platform
* Good for small desktop tools and forms

---

**Q33. How can we connect this form to a database?**
**A:** We can use `sqlite3` or `mysql.connector` to **store registration details** in a database table instead of just displaying them in a messagebox.

---

**Q34. How can you restrict the user from entering invalid email format?**
**A:** By adding a condition that checks if `'@'` and `'.'` exist in the email before submission.

---

**Q35. What happens if the user closes the form window manually?**
**A:** The `mainloop()` ends and the program stops running.

✅ **Bonus Viva Tip (Short 1-Minute Verbal Summary)**

If your teacher asks you to *explain the code*, say this:

> “This program creates a **Student Registration Form** using Tkinter.
> The user enters name, email, selects gender, chooses a course from a Listbox, and agrees to the terms.
> When they click **Register**, the program collects all data, validates inputs, and shows the registration details in a popup.
> If any field is empty, it shows an error message.
> The **Clear** button resets the form, and all widgets are organized using the grid layout system.”
